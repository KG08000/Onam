<p>Lord Vishnu transformed himself into a dwarf named Vamana and attended a Yaagam hosted by King Mahabali. 
Vamana asked for three feet of land, which King Mahabali granted.   
Vamana began to grow larger and claim the Earth and heaven. 
King Mahabali offered his head to keep his word. 
Lord Vishnu sent Mahabali to the netherworld, but allowed him to visit his subjects once a year. 
The day of Mahabali's return is celebrated as Onam. </p>
 <h3><b><i>Pookkalam</h3></b></i>
<img src="pookalam.jpeg">
 <p>One of the vibrant parts of the Onam celebrations is the making of Pookkalam. 
    Athappookkalam is symbolic of prosperity and joy. Starting from the day of Atham,
   pookkalams are made to welcome Mahabali. 
   In earlier times, only locally available flowers were used to create Pookkalams.
   All over Kerala, Pookalam competitions are a common sight on Onam day.
   is made out of the gathered blossoms with several varieties of flowers of differing tints pinched up into little pieces to design and decorate patterns on the floor, 
   particularly at entrances and temple premises like a flower mat. 
   Lamps are arranged in the middle or edges. It is a work of religious art.</p>
